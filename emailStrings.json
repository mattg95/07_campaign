      "I keep hearing the government saying that we can’t provide the same levels of aid because of the impact of this pandemic, but this doesn’t exactly make sense. The aid target of 0.7% is a percentage of GNI, which means that the aid budget will go down in any case.",
      "I can definitely understand the challenges this pandemic brings to the UK and its economy, but reducing the aid target just doesn’t make sense. It’s not a set amount, but rather a percentage of GNI, so the aid budget will be reduced anyway.",

      "Please don’t send me a standard reply telling me that the government thinks we need to provide less aid because the UK has less money. The 0.7% is a percentage of GNI, so it will actually go down automatically without you needing to reduce the percentage even more.",
      "I’d appreciate your full response, rather than a standard party line response telling me that because of the pandemic, our government thinks we have less money ourselves. As 0.7% depends on our national income, the amount would go down anyway.",
      "Please could you send me your full response, and not a standard reply explaining how our economy is affected by this pandemic. I’m aware that our aid budget is a percentage of GDP, so it was always going to go down anyway.",
      "I’d really appreciate your own response, not a standard party line, telling me how the pandemic has affected our economy. I’m aware that the aid budget is a percentage of GNI, so that argument just isn’t valid.",
      "Please do not respond by writing to me that our government is reducing the aid budget because our country has less money because of the pandemic. As aid budget is calculated as a percentage of GNI, it will be reduced either way.",
      "I saw something somewhere which said that the government thinks it’s OK to go against its manifesto promises because the UK is worse off financially at the moment. Could you please explain this to me carefully? I understood that the formula automatically reduces the amount of aid going overseas when we have less income ourselves, which means we don’t have to punish the poor on top of that any more than we already will?",
      "I’ve read somewhere that our government says it’s fine to reduce the aid budget and break its manifesto promises because our country is in economic decline. Could you please tell me about the reasons behind this thinking? As the aid budget is a percentage of our GNI, the amount is already reduced. Doesn’t this mean we shouldn’t reduce it even more, so it worsens conditions for so many more people?",
      "I’ve heard something that said that our government argues it’s acceptable to break their own manifesto promises by reducing UK aid just because the UK is doing worse financially. I would appreciate your explanation behind these reasons, as I don’t fully understand them. I know that because of how aid is calculated, the amount will go down anyway. So why should we reduce it more, when so many people will lose out on our aid already?",
      "I’ve now heard it a few times that our government defends their move to lower the aid target by saying that the UK’s economy is struggling. But to my understanding, the aid budget will go down anyway, because it’s calculated as a percentage of our GNI. So please explain it to me, why does the government want to reduce it even more, and push more people into poverty?",
      "I believe the government justifies this by saying that the UK is worse off financially at the moment. Could you please explain this to me very clearly? I understood that the 0.7% is a percentage of GNI, which means it automatically reduces the amount of aid going overseas when we have less income ourselves.? Doesn’t this mean we’re reducing the amount of aid we send anyway?",
      "If the government points to our own financial situation as justification for this, that would be disappointingly weak thinking.The 0.7% is a percentage of GNI, which means it automatically reduces the amount of aid going overseas anyway? Please confirm that you have understood this, and therefore that you don’t believe that ‘we have less money’ is a reasonable justification for the government’s decision to go back on its promises.",
      "Can I just add one more fact that I think lots of people (other than the government) are understanding: the 0.7% is a percentage of national income. This means that if the UK is worse off, we are *automatically* providing less aid.",
      "While the UK certainly faces financial difficulties, my understanding is that the 0.7% allocated to foreign aid is a proportion of national income, and so already takes these challenges into account. I do not understand how the government can use financial hardship as justification when it is lower-income nations that have been hit hardest by the global pandemic.",
      "Although the UK is also undergoing financial difficulties, as the 0.7% is a percentage of national income, our aid budget is already being reduced. I do not understand why we are further reducing it.",

      "I understand that Covid has brought many fiscal challenges within the UK and we are financially constrained ourselves but as the aid budget is a percentage of GDP and will reduce anyway, can you please explain why we need to go back against our 0.7% commitments?",
      "I know that the UK government is fiscally constrained right now and we have less money ourselves, however as the aid budget is a proportion of our national income, it will automatically go down. I do not understand why you are supporting further reducing an already smaller aid budget.",
      "I wanted to clarify a potential misunderstanding here - as the aid budget is a percentage of UK GDP, it reduces automatically when the UK GDP shrinks. It is a weak justification to say that the UK is worse off right now and so it is ok to reduce the aid budget.",
      "As the UK aid budget is a proportion of national income, it automatically goes down when the UK is financially suffering. How can you justify further reducing the aid budget when it is already going down?",
      "I am disappointed by the reasoning that the UK is financially suffering right now so it is ok to reduce the 0.7% aid commitment. The 0.7% is based on a percentage of GNI so the aid budget is already reducing when our GNI goes down. Can you explain why it makes sense to reduce it further?",
      "I know that we are facing financial difficulties because of the pandemic, but so is the rest of the world. The fact that our aid budget is calculated as a percentage of GDP means that it will already be falling, so there is no need to cut it further and add to people’s misery.",
      "I can appreciate that Covid-19 has been detrimental to the UK’s economy, and that there is a need to be responsible with spending. However, surely this is part of the reason why international aid spending is set at a percentage of GNI - so that it automatically increases and decreases with the country’s finances?",
      "I know that the UK is facing financial difficulties at the present time, but we are not alone in this, and people’s suffering overseas is just as real as it is in the UK - besides, as a percentage of national income, our aid budget is automatically being reduced without the need for additional cuts to worsen the situation.",
      "The aid budget is already being reduced as national income is under pressure from the pandemic, additional cuts are unnecessary and will only worsen the situation.",
      "As national income is falling, the aid budget is automatically falling with it. Removing the 0.7% target is therefore unnecessary in my opinion, it will make little difference to the UK’s overall finances but a huge difference to potential recipients who miss out.",
      "I am not sure why the government is trying to justify this because of the economic problems in the UK - as a percentage of national income the aid budget is already being reduced, and removing this target will put additional people at risk."
